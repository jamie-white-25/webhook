## Webhook Test

I've completed the test to the best of my ability, but please note I've never used webhooks before. I've not added any authentication for this test, but I would use sanctum to authenticate the API endpoints before deploying to production.  

## Setup

- sail command 
./vendor/bin/sail

I'm using laravel sail, so you will need docker to run this. To get started run composer install. To run the sail commands you need to run 
./vendor/bin/sail, so to run artisan you'll need to run ./vendor/bin/sail artisan. Rename the .env.example to .env and set the database password as password and run the sail command up -d this should start the docker containers. 

Once the containers have started, generate the the APP_KEY, and then run the sail command artisan sail:install  and install mysql, and once that is done then you can run the sail command and migrate and seed the database.
